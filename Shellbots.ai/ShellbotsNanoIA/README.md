üöÄ Shellbots NanoAI: A revolution for your AI or AI use projects ü§ñ

We are delighted to announce that ShellbotsOS and Shellbots, our environment and framework dedicated to AI, will now be integrated into our Shellbots NanoAI machines (Already available in the cloud on Azure, AWS and others)!

These machines are designed from two different possible architectures :
* **NVIDIA Jetson modules** to offer you a robust and efficient solution for your artificial intelligence projects in local or cloud.
* **Raspberry pi 5 with AI HAT+** with shellbots tools and Nvidia tools in the cloud for more computing power !

A presentation will be made at the **World Summit AI Montreal in April 2025 !** and like last year with practical concrete examples!

These computers are **aimed at our customers and beginners, students as well as professionals in the different fields of AI**: Automation, Generative AI, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Robotics, Object Recognition, Vision, Development, etc.
We have **integrated under a custom ShellbotsOS Linux kernel** (Ubuntu base), a multitude of **open source AI tools, enterprise solutions (Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, etc.) as well as our Shellbots framework to quickly create specialized AI services**.   

**Whether you are working on:**   
>ü§ñ Advanced robotics and autonomous robots   
>üè• Health and medical analysis   
>üì∏ Image recognition and computer vision   
>üìä Machine Learning and AI deployments in the field   

Shellbots NanoAI and ShellbotsOS offer you an optimized environment to accelerate the development and integration of your solutions.
